I'm honored to receive [Undergraduate Summer Research Program (UGSRP)](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/student-research/undergraduate-summer-research-program) Mentor of the Year Award. My heartfelt thanks to my incredible mentees — Jury Alrumaihi, William Abraham, and Andy Park — for their nomination and recognition.
